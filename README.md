Sliding-Window
==============

Sliding Window: implements the sender and the receiver that communicate using the GBN protocol with UDP

Little word of caution: theres a lot of memory leak going on here, so clone it fix have fun with it.
One more thing I sort of miss interpret the sliding part, it really does it in chunks.
