This is just for referenece when I forget.

Window win
WINDOWSIZE = 6
// next: next pkt I'm going to send, base: the pkt that needs to be recv
next = 0, base = 0
send_iter = 0, recv_iter = 0, temp_iter = 0

index : 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

When sending a pkt:

int index = next - (WINDOWSIZE * send_iter);
if(next >= WINDOWSIZE*(send_iter+1)){ send_iter++; }

// I'm going to place the value of the var by doing ":0"
// here we placing a pkt in window 0
ex. index:0 = next:0 - (WINDOWSIZE:6 * send_iter:0)

now say next:6
if(next:6 >= WINDOWSIZE:6 * (send_iter:0 + 1)){ send_iter:1 }

now that next is 6 we are essentially going back to index 0
ex. index:0 = next:6 - (WINDOWSIZE:6 * send_iter:1)

so on and so forth we keep looping back to index:0 because 

iteration is 0: index : 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 
....
iteration is n: index : 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
